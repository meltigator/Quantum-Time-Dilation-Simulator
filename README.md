Quantum Time Dilation Simulator - FPGA Project

Bridging Einstein's Relativity with Quantum Mechanics

I've developed an open-source FPGA-based simulator that visualizes one of physics' most mind-bending phenomena: how gravity warps time itself. This project demonstrates how time accelerates as we move away from Earth - an effect measured in nanoseconds but with profound cosmic implications.

Why this matters:

    Combines general relativity (gravitational time dilation) with quantum mechanics (Planck-scale discretization)

    Makes tangible Einstein's prediction that clocks run faster in orbit (validated by GPS satellites)

    Explores cutting-edge theories about time's quantum nature

Technical highlights:

(+) FPGA-accelerated physics engine

    Real-time dilation calculations using √(1 - 2GM/rc²)

    Quantum time discretization at 5.39×10⁻⁴⁴s resolution

    Hardware/simulation dual modes

(+) Immersive visualization

    WebGL 3D cosmic environment

    Animated spacetime curvature models

    Dynamic altitude vs. time difference plots

(+) Cross-platform framework

    MSYS2/Windows/Linux compatible

    Bash control center with interactive menus

    CSV data pipeline for analysis

The science in action:
The simulator reveals how at 10,000m altitude, time flows ~30 nanoseconds/day faster than at sea level - a tiny but measurable effect that impacts GPS systems and proves time isn't absolute.

Perfect for STEM educators, physics enthusiasts, and engineers interested in:

    Relativistic computing

    Quantum gravity concepts

    FPGA scientific applications

    Physics visualization
